/**
 * The Navigation Bar spans the top of the viewport and provides access to key navigation elements. Its structure and content adapt by breakpoint, working together with the Portal Navigation Menu for a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

 * On desktop and tablet landscape (≥769px), the Nav Bar includes the Services Menu on the left, with Switch Partner and Profile on the right. The logo does not appear here — it is part of the Portal Navigation Menu (sidebar).

 * On tablet portrait and mobile (≤768px), the Nav Bar includes the logo on the left, the Services Menu centered, and a hamburger trigger on the right that opens the Drawer. Switch Partner and Profile are consolidated into the Drawer for these breakpoints.
